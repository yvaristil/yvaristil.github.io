This is meant to be a filler post, so ignore (unless you geek out about planes)

Basically I've had this big idea in mind (not common), that I want to pursure fligt training.
The thing is there are a lot of ways to fly your own aircraft, rainging from piston engined planes, helicopters, gliders, and even those weird microlights.
Finland being prone to high tax rates, the training for most of these is expensive.
In order to get a PPL from the most affordable flight school near me, you'll have to let go of 12.000 euros (not including medical exams, theory exams etc)
So I came to the conclusion that that won't be happening any time soon.
I found out that ultralight aircraft exist
and that you can become a pilot for one.
So I found the perfect flightschool for ultralight aircraft training: MILK.
Although the training is consciderably more affordable relative to PPL clubs, it still was out of my budget.
Yet again, I searched for another alternative.
Then...
As my hope was dwindling...
I came across the wonderful ecosystem of sailplanes.
Granted, I've known about them since forever, but not to a deep extent.
I got mesmorized with the idea of being able to fly without the need of an external engine!
So I began the search for yet another flight club...
and then I found it: HYIK.
They are the best option, because:
  1. They are the most affordable.
  2. They are located a quick drive away from my grandparents house, so theretically I could do flight training at a daily basis.
  3. I don't have another reason.
     
But yeah, that's that with me and sailplanes.
My preferred sailplane currently is the Jonker Sailplanes JS3 RES.
Oh man, it is almost 1AM.
My dumb self decided to bike 150km last week, and now I think I'll do it all over again.
Not when I'm staying up this late haha.
