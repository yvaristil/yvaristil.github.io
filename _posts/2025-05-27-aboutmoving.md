I've lived in the same row house for about a decade now.

That changes tomorrow, as I move to a new house with my family.

Adam is looking at me typing this on the almost empty floor of our bedroom at 21:24 right now.

I am skeptical

I hope that this new home will not only bring us additional square meters to walk on,

but also a chance for this uncertain family situation to reform.

I will put my effort to my fullest to bring that closer to a reality.

InshaAllah.
