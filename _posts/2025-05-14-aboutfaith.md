For man to be, it is essential that they believe in a higher power.

It was an undisputed norm that in the past, a person's religion and their belief in God was this higher power.

Unfortunately, this is not the case today.

As atheism has become a trend, people find themselves lost, simply because they have nothing anymore to believe in, which one could argue is a natrual instict of the human being!

So what is the outcome?

Outrageous extremes forming, to fill that void.

The righteous belief in God has become scarce.

Although it is important to point out, that as these outrageous extremes push their twisted agendas, so does the oppsition.

A new slowly evolving trend is traditional values, the most important being the belief in God.

It is still a slow process,

but one day in the future it will become the trend.

People are like tides.

They shift from one belief to another, 

however doing that repeatedly causes foam to form on the coast of the beach.

The foam may be plenty, but the strength is poor.

We should remember not only to focus on the amount of believers, but the quality of our beliefs.
