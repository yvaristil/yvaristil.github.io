I actually forgot to write this last night, so I'm writing this in the monring now (17.5)

Thing is I don't have much to say.

I'll be running today though.

Second running comp. I'll do, so it's interesting to see how well I perform.

5km is a reasonable distance for this year, aiming to get a 4.30sec/km pace of below.

Next year, the half marathon is definetaly on my list.
