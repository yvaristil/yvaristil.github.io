I'm not sure how long I'll actually keep these blog posts going, but here's an interesting thought for today:

*Why are we (westerners) relentless to take action despite being rich with opportunities?*

It could stem down from the fact that if one has always been exposed to an environment in which everything is automatically provided, the urge to take action is hard to come by.

Thing is, the blessing and oportunities are open to us because somebody else is doing something for something...

as there is no such thing as nothing for something.

And most often, those "something doers" are one's parents.

And we (unripe brain children) seem to forget that preeettyy often...

So when you go pick up the mail from the post box like any other day, but this time you see a paper from YTK with the credentials of your ____ noted on the cover, the realization suffocates you with guilt.

You think about the work they've put towards you and the rest, despite the *many* *many* *many* *many* heated conflicts you've experienced throught.

It is for oneself to decide if they will resume walking on the path of arbitrary selfish projects that circumnavigate the root cause, and don't provide and immidiate outcome...

Or, to search, identify, and find a solution to what is causing distress.

It is up to the intention of the person to decide on how to take action.
