Been a bit since I wrote one of these, so these clearly aren't something I'll be posting daily.

Anyhow, I've recently been taking furniture apart and backing boxes for an upcoming move.

And I thought to myself "Although this labour demanding work is somewhat difficult, I could do this all day long!"

Which is funny, because I struggle to have the same mindset with less concrete task, especially internet based ones.

Now here me out, I do love technology, and I don't intend on sounding like a WW2 vetaran who still uses a typewriter (although they are pretty damn cool)...

But I can't wrap my head around working as hard on computer-based tasks versus physical concrete tasks.

It could stem from the fact that technology has developed at a pase that our brains simply cannot comprehend...

So when we're asked to make somekind of project on the computer versus doing it by hand and actually building it, the latter seems more doable, even though it might be physically and maybe even mentally more demanding (since the computer isn't helping you out anymore)

Who knows, maybe this is all just bs I am comiting on this markdown file right now, but I sure do hope I can get my hands on my grandmas typewriter at some point.
